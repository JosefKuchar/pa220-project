# Dimensional Model Description

![ERD of star schema](erd.png)

## Dimensions

### Car_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual car
- SCD type: Type 2
- Type 2 was chosen because we want to keep track of changes in car attributes over time (e.g. license plate number for speeding tickets)

### AppInstance_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual application instance
- It was created to easily filter out, aggregate data for specific application instance
- SCD type: None

### Phone_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual phone
- It was created to easily filter out, aggregate data for specific phone
- SCD type: None

### Company_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual company
- It was created to easily filter out, aggregate data for specific company
- SCD type: None

### Driver_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual driver
- It was created to easily filter out, aggregate data for specific driver
- SCD type: Type 1
- Type 1 was chosen because we don't need to keep track of changes in driver's name and we only care about current driver information

### Operator_Dimension
- This dimension represents individual operator
- It was created to easily filter out, aggregate data for specific operator
- SCD type: None

//NOTE: Changes in car association to app instance are reflected by relations in fact table

## Fact table

- Type: snapshot
- Primary key selection (fact granularity): Car, AppInstance, Time, Location, Phone, Company, Driver, Operator (granularity is corresponding to one health record in original representation)

### Degenerate dimension: Time_Dimension
- It's a degenerate dimension because it's part of primary key in fact table, but doesn't contain any additional attributes

### Degenerate dimension: Location_Dimension
- It's a degenerate dimension because it's part of primary key in fact table, but doesn't contain any additional attributes
- This dimension represents individual GPS location

### Service_Key
- Original primary key from import_health table
- Type: non-additive

### Number_of_Connections
- Aggregated number of connections related to health record as proposed in Part B (values.txt)
- Type: additive

### Battery_Level
- Phone battery level at the time of health record
- Type: non-additive

### App_Runtime
- Application runtime at the time of health record
- Type: non-additive

### Dev_Runtime
- Device runtime at the time of health record
- Type: non-additive

### Device_Name
- Device name (model)
- Type: non-additive
