# Incremental ETL process

- Total time to insert new data in staging: 9.691 seconds

[ETL incremental script](etl-incr.sql)


- Comment on the ideas/steps used in the implementation:
- We suppose that the data in update table is already cleaned and validated (We didn't normalize the data on purpose - IVECO -> Iveco)
- We created new records in the date dimension for each missing date
- We decided to filter out 11 fact update records that contained lots of null values
- We decided to substitute missing foreign keys with -1 as we saw this approach had been used before in the public schema
- We wanted to link dimensions that were valid at the time of each fact update record, but the 'valid_from' value is 2024-11-01 for all companies for example
- To solve this issue, we added the "OR car.current_row = 'active'" condition
